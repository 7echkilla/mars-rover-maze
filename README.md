# Autonomous M.A.R.S Rover Navigation
This project focuses on developing an autonomous navigation system for the [**4tronix M.A.R.S. Rover Robot**](https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=2112). The rover will autonomously navigate through a maze, with the possibility for manual control using a keypad, although the use of manual control is forowned upon and penalised.

## 🚀 Objective
The goal is to create an autonomous maze-solving system for the M.A.R.S. Rover, using sensors and algorithms to detect the environment and navigate through the maze without human intervention. Manual control is only allowed as a fallback.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Hardware:
  - [4tronix M.A.R.S. Rover](https://core-electronics.com.au/4tronix-m-a-r-s-rover-robot-for-raspberry-pi-zero.html)
  - [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-zero-wh.html) (or any compatible Raspberry Pi)
  - Maze environment (physical setup)
- Software:
  - [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)
  - Python 3.x
  - Required Python libraries (e.g., RPi.GPIO, time, numpy, opencv, etc.)
  - Git for version control
